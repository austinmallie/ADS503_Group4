This project uses the Global Coral Bleaching Database to explore predictive modeling techniques to estimate coral bleaching percentages. The study evaluates model accuracy in capturing bleaching severity from geographic and environmental predictors by applying nine predictive models to the data: linear regression, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), penalized regressions, Partial Least Squares (PLS), decision tree, random forests, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The goal is to support proactive decision-making in ecological conservation and marine resource planning. Using a blend of R models, we investigate the predictive power of environmental and spatial features such as temperature and latitude. Our analysis focuses on predictive performance, interpretability, model robustness, and generalization to unseen data. The results of this work offer actionable insight for stakeholders in conservation, tourism, and marine research. Preliminary results indicate that while linear models offer interpretability, nonlinear techniques may more effectively capture complex bleaching dynamics.
